```
Date | Role | Company | Application Status | Location | Cover Letter | App URL | Internal Contact | Email
```

**Option 2: Custom Setup**
- Use any Google Sheet structure
- Extension writes to the first available row
- Data goes in columns A-I

### Finding Your Google Sheets ID

1. **Open your Google Sheet**
2. **Look at the URL**: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Abc123.../edit`
3. **Copy the long ID** between `/d/` and `/edit`
4. **That's your Sheet ID!**

### Common Setup Issues

**❌ "Unable to parse range: Sheet1"**
- **Solution**: Your sheet tab isn't named "Sheet1"
- The extension auto-detects the first sheet name
- No action needed - this is normal!

**❌ "Auth failed"**
- **Solution**: Try the "Test Connection" button first
- Make sure you authorize with the same Google account
- Check that your Google account has access to the sheet
